+ **CAM autorestart** - simple plugin for auto-restarting the HardwareCAM device, every few days, at a certain preset time
   > - The plugin was remaked as a request from @CornFlakes999 (for Python3 support).
   > - This is supposedly the only possible solution for the correct functioning of the Swiss Kabelio Module, in Enigma2 set-top boxes.
   > - Unfortunately, I do not have more information about the need to restart the Swiss Kabelio Module for every 24 hours.

+ **Chocholousek Picons** - plugin for updating Chocholousek's picons in Enigma2
   > - The plugin downloads a series of file archives (7-zip) with picons, for user-selected satellite positions. From the archives, the plugin unpacks only the necessary picons to the internal disk (depending on the service reference codes found in the "userboquet" files).
   > - The original intent for developing this plugin was to save free space on the device's internal disk.

+ **EPG Export**
   > - A NOTE: the plugin is still only in the testing stage ! it is not a 100% functional plugin !
   > - plugin for exporting EPG data in Enigma2, to XML format
   > - the plugin was forked from here: https://github.com/leaskovski/EPGExport
   > - the plugin source code has been refactored to support Python3

+ **EPG Download & Replace**
   > - Simple enigma2 plugin to download & replace '/etc/enigma2/epg.dat' file in the Enigma2 set-top box.
   > - I haven't updated this simple plugin for a very long time :-) and I don't know if it will work correctly. Sorry.
