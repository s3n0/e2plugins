2.0.191109
Solved problem with loading the saved configuration of satellites ... after restarting the set-top box, it was not possible to load saved configuration of satellites (thanks to @saragusa).
Resolved issue with TV+RADIO updating method (thanks to @chocholousek).

2.0.191110
Solved a problem with slow internet connection - the timeout duration has been increased (thanks to @saragusa).

2.0.191111
Further code tuning for OE2.5 users - for ".deb" packages (thanks to @chocholousek).
Finally fixed the problem with incorrect saving / loading of satellite selection settings.

2.0.191115
Added new method of updating picons - copying all picons, without deleting them all, just as an incremental update (files of different size and non-existent files will be copied to your disk).
I added this method because many users are copying a huge number of picons for many satellites without syncing them.
This method is faster than the first method (with removing all picons first and then copying all picons).

2.0.191117
In this released version already assumes and discards the background, if they do not exist for a specific selection of satellites. Unfortunately, not all picons Chocholousek prepares for all resolutions and for all backgrounds or vice versa for all satellites (by resolution or background).

2.0.191118
Patch for the incorrect plugin installation under OE2.5 Enigma (.deb installation packages), during online plugin update.

2.0.191125
Fixed detection of OE2.0 (OE-Alliance 4.?) vs OE2.5+ (Dreambox) when trying to install "p7zip" package from the Enigma feed.
Move buttons and font size for FullHD SKIN buttons (only a slight distance).

2.0.191126
Added missing text in localization files. Translation of these missing texts from EN language into SK and CZ languages.

2.0.191215
Added German language.
Increasing the proportions of the configuration window in FHD resolution (too large font for yellow button description in case of OE2.5 still does not want to be squeezed into one line).
Other minor changes.

2.0.200107
Fixed bug with plugin crash in new DMM firmware after opening satellite configuration window. Thanks to @chocholousek.

2.0.200125
Fixed the process when upgrading a plugin package under OE 2.5+ (adding a line in the CONTROL shell-script). Thanks to @fly.tox .

2.0.200126
If the installation of the 7-zip archiver was successful, I will try again to download the preview picons (.7z file from the internet),
because at the beginning of the config screen entry it wasn't possible to download the preview picons - because of the non-existent 7-zip archiver.

2.0.200127
Minor adjustment in unnecessary picons deletion algorithm - in case of method of synchronization of picons with userbouquet files (channel lists). Thanks to @chocholousek . 
Not all unknown .png files have been deleted from the picon directory... after fixing the bug, all unknown files will be deleted correctly (for example as "sat.1.png"),
since this is a method of synchronization and the algorithm only counts with png files named as SRC code.

2.0.200221
Added Turkish language.

2.0.200311
Fixed problem with importing non-existent "subprocess" module in older versions of Python - that is, in older Enigma2 (OpenPLi-4 / DM800 HD). Thanks to @Hitman222.

2.0.200317
Added indirect support for downloading additional third-party picons (for example, for some IPTV services) from a third-party online source.
The picons must be located inside the archive in the root folder - i.e. without folders inside the archive. The archive format must be 7-zip.
The configuration file is located here: "/etc/enigma2/3rd_party_picons.ini". Comments in a file are allowed only after the # character at the beginning of a line.
If the file does not exist or the resource list in the file remains empty, it will be ignored. 

Example of the file "/etc/enigma2/3rd_party_picons.ini":

2.0.200321
Removed informative text during picon update - using sync methods. This is misleading information about preparing files for unpacking, and the information previously mentions unpacking.
Minor changes in the source code.

2.0.200323
Fixed problems updating / downloading preview picons. Thanks to @Hitman222.

2.0.200406
Added Lithuanian language.

2.0.200409
Added Polish language.
Improved algorithm for detecting chipset architecture aarch64 / arm64 (debugged on the Enigma core - OE 2.6), thx to @alexbore.
Accepting sym-links to 7-zip executable file.
Changed Enigma core detection method - instead of detecting the Enigma core version, only the type of core will be detected (used for skin modification and timer function).
