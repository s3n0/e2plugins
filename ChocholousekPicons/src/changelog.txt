2.0.191109
Solved problem with loading the saved configuration of satellites ... after restarting the set-top box, it was not possible to load saved configuration of satellites (thanks to @saragusa).
Resolved issue with TV+RADIO updating method (thanks to @chocholousek).

2.0.191110
Solved a problem with slow internet connection - the timeout duration has been increased (thanks to @saragusa).

2.0.191111
Further code tuning for OE2.5 users - for ".deb" packages (thanks to @chocholousek).
Finally fixed the problem with incorrect saving / loading of satellite selection settings.

2.0.191115
Added new method of updating picons - copying all picons, without deleting them all, just as an incremental update (files of different size and non-existent files will be copied to your disk).
I added this method because many users are copying a huge number of picons for many satellites without syncing them.
This method is faster than the first method (with removing all picons first and then copying all picons).

2.0.191117
In this released version already assumes and discards the background, if they do not exist for a specific selection of satellites. Unfortunately, not all picons Chocholousek prepares for all resolutions and for all backgrounds or vice versa for all satellites (by resolution or background).

2.0.191118
Patch for the incorrect plugin installation under OE2.5 Enigma (.deb installation packages), during online plugin update.

2.0.191125
Fixed detection of OE2.0 (OE-Alliance 4.?) vs OE2.5+ (Dreambox) when trying to install "p7zip" package from the Enigma feed.
Move buttons and font size for FullHD SKIN buttons (only a slight distance).

2.0.191126
Added missing text in localization files. Translation of these missing texts from EN language into SK and CZ languages.

2.0.191215
Added German language.
Increasing the proportions of the configuration window in FHD resolution (too large font for yellow button description in case of OE2.5 still does not want to be squeezed into one line).
Other minor changes.

2.0.200107
Fixed bug with plugin crash in new DMM firmware after opening satellite configuration window. Thanks to @chocholousek.

2.0.200125
Fixed the process when upgrading a plugin package under OE 2.5+ (adding a line in the CONTROL shell-script). Thanks to @fly.tox .

2.0.200126
If the installation of the 7-zip archiver was successful, I will try again to download the preview picons (.7z file from the internet),
because at the beginning of the config screen entry it wasn't possible to download the preview picons - because of the non-existent 7-zip archiver.

2.0.200127
Minor adjustment in unnecessary picons deletion algorithm - in case of method of synchronization of picons with userbouquet files (channel lists). Thanks to @chocholousek . 
Not all unknown .png files have been deleted from the picon directory... after fixing the bug, all unknown files will be deleted correctly (for example as "sat.1.png"),
since this is a method of synchronization and the algorithm only counts with png files named as SRC code.

2.0.200221
Added Turkish language.

2.0.200311
Fixed problem with importing non-existent "subprocess" module in older versions of Python - that is, in older Enigma2 (OpenPLi-4 / DM800 HD). Thanks to @Hitman222.

2.0.200317
Added indirect support for downloading additional third-party picons (for example, for some IPTV services) from a third-party online source.
The picons must be located inside the archive in the root folder - i.e. without folders inside the archive. The archive format must be 7-zip.
The configuration file is located here: "/etc/enigma2/3rd_party_picons.ini". Comments in a file are allowed only after the # character at the beginning of a line.
If the file does not exist or the resource list in the file remains empty, it will be ignored. 

Example of the file "/etc/enigma2/3rd_party_picons.ini":

### Chocholousek picons, Enigma2 plugin, https://github.com/s3n0
# http://example.com/files/picons.7z
http://download.test.net/files/my_picons.7z

2.0.200321
Removed informative text during picon update - using sync methods. This is misleading information about preparing files for unpacking, and the information previously mentions unpacking.
Minor changes in the source code.

2.0.200323
Fixed problems updating / downloading preview picons. Thanks to @Hitman222.

2.0.200406
Added Lithuanian language.

2.0.200409
Added Polish language.
Improved algorithm for detecting chipset architecture aarch64 / arm64 (debugged on the Enigma core - OE 2.6), thx to @alexbore.
Accepting sym-links to 7-zip executable file.
Changed Enigma core detection method - instead of detecting the Enigma core version, only the type of core will be detected (used for skin modification and timer function).

2.0.200410
Added Russian language (by @FRAP).

2.0.200411
Updated Lithuanian language (by @Adga).
Minor improvements (added a method for detecting dpkg and opkg package managers, reverting the previous Enigma core detection algorithm - again the detection of new cores is based on OE version numbers).
Trying to run the plugin also on the old, complicated Enigma distribution and that is:
- NewNigma2 (based on OpenDreambox) firmware / OE 2.0 core / opkg manager / Python 2.7.2 (deadly combination = big problems) / DM800SE set-top box ... but problems still persist with Thread and access to e2-configuration
Detecting a new version of preview picons as well as detecting new Chocholousek content is triggered by the same algorithm as downloading picons, i.e. there is an improved algorithm for downloading files from drive.google (virus warning message and endless SSL issues).

2.0.200412
Fixed a problem on image DreamboxOS 4.3.2 / core OE 2.5 with a 7-zip archiver problem that did not extract files due to a malfunctioning wildcard convention "*.png". Thanks to @mjozef.

2.0.200424
Minor fixes for some SKINs (in NewNigma2 / OE2.0):
- thanks to @alexbore, for renting a set-top box for remote debugging of the source code (DM800HDse with NewNigma2 / OE2.0)
- determining the position of the nested widget via "center,center" does not work, therefore it's necessary to use the relative determination of the position "x,y"
- removed the ability to scroll the list in the satellite configuration window, via the left / right buttons on the RCU, as the .pageUp() and .pageDown() methods for the ConfigList does not work in some Enigmas (SKINs)
- fixed error "FATAL!: addTimer must be called from thread 3261 but is called from thread 3680" (probably a bug in some C-libraries in some Enigma distributions)
Added "Cancel" button in the satellite configuration window (including improved control of changes made by the user).

2.1.200427
A directory browser has been added - for the purpose of selecting a user-defined picon folder. 
- !!! please be careful when deleting and creating folders in the directory browser !
- !!! you are responsible for any loss of important data, after accidentally deleting the directory !
Minor changes in the source code.

2.1.200504
Improved Russian language (by @FRAP).
Minor changes in the source code.

2.1.200506
Minor changes in the source code.
Fixed a bug in the non-existent Python module "requests", when the plugin refused to load into the list in the Plugin-MENU:
- it's a remnant of a function from previous source code
- the "requests" module was used to test the alternate function
Design:
- the list of selected satellites in the configuration menu has changed to abbreviated text with the number of selected satellites together
- added unicode circle character (emptied / filled) in the selection of satellite positions, for their better visibility
Localization:
- added missing dot in one sentence, in translation files
- improved Russian language (by @FRAP)

2.1.200524
Fixed bug in case of Enigma2 TeamBlue, on Gigablue devices - thanks to @dejanf.
- there is a variable PACKAGE_VERSION imported from the module 'enigma', but instead of three values (version: major, minor, patch) it provides only two values and I don't know why

3.1.200720
Changed file-hosting server for downloading picon archives, thanks to Ellano (https://ellano.sk): from https://drive.google.com -> to -> https://picon.cz
Fixed a bug that caused the satellite selection window to open slowly.

3.1.200926
Added a new option to quickly restart the Enigma (GUI) after updating the picons.

3.1.201103
Added support for non-standard userbouquet files (lowercase) in Enigma, after using the DreamSet application:
- unfortunately, DreamSet uploads userbouquet files with lowercase characters to the set-top box and therefore no matching service reference codes are found
- the process of comparing service reference codes from userbouquet files will no longer be case sensitive

4.0.210129
Source code modified to support both versions of Python 2 and 3 at the same time.
Fixed description for the plugin:
- picons are supported mainly for satellite positions from Europe
- other satellite positions are less supported ... such as satellites in Russia (not all satellites from Russia are supported)

4.0.210130
For the needs of OpenATV-6.5 alpha version (based on Python 3.8.x), ".py" files are inserted into the installation package instead of ".pyo" files.

4.0.210214
Add log output to the file "/tmp/chocholousek-picons.log", while updating picons.
Added testing of the connection to the server, which contains picon packages, after testing the internet connection.
Minor syntax modification according to PEP8 E251.
Renaming some functions (source code) to make them clearer.

4.0.210301
Improved Lithuanian language from 2021-02-16 (thx to @Adga).
Fixed a minor bug in the sorting of database files in a folder:
- the error could theoretically cause the database update of available picons to be stuck
- so sorting files by algorithm is now alphabetical, not by creation date
Created and added a new bb-recipe to OpenATV feeds (thx to @Nicker):
- https://github.com/nickersk/oe-alliance-core/commit/28b8f38765f77da37ac1297ae3d724713dad54b9
- https://github.com/oe-alliance/oe-alliance-core/blob/4.4/meta-oe/recipes-distros/openatv/image/openatv-feeds.bb
- https://github.com/oe-alliance/oe-alliance-core/blob/4.4/meta-oe/recipes-oe-alliance/enigma2-plugins/enigma2-plugin-extensions-chocholousek-picons.bb

4.0.210302
Added Greek language (by @MCelliotG).

4.0.210427
Fixed a minor bug in the list of picons loaded from local disk:
- the list of file names on the local disk was created incorrectly, including SRN file names
- the plugin only works with SRC file names, so deleting "unnecessary" SRN file names is undesirable
- the plugin from this version or later will completely ignore files named as SRN
- thx to @manuel06

4.0.210428
Fixed path to non-traditional picons directories:
- the letter "s" was missing at the end of the "ZZPicon" and "XPicon" directory names
- in the case of the "/media/hdd" and "/media/usb" subdirectories
- thx to @steiff

4.0.210429
Fixed typo: "XPpicons" to "XPicons"
Added OLED 96x64 picons for the front display of some devices.

5.0.210501
Added multiple configuration profiles:
- since there has also been a change in the system file "/etc/enigma2/settings",
  it is recommended to delete "chocholousekpicons" old configuration entries, for example using an online script:
     wget -qO- --no-check-certificate "https://github.com/s3n0/e2plugins/raw/master/ChocholousekPicons/online-setup" | bash -s del-config
The ability to check and save the plugin configuration is removed:
- the plugin configuration is SAVED AUTOMATICALLY and immediately after each change
- the red "Exit" button has been replaced by "Profile reset" for this purpose
- the green button is used to exit the plugin
New option to add default picon directories, for Enigma2 administrators and developers:
- create a text file "/etc/enigma2/chocholousekpicons.cfg" (Unix/Linux newlines)
- insert the configuration section [picon_dir] into the file and insert the required directories to the picons below it (one line = one directory)
- note: this file will also be used instead of the original file "/etc/enigma2/3rd_party_picons.ini",
  which was intended for downloading external archives 7z with picons (for example SRN picons) - only under configuration profile number 1 !!!,
  just add a configuration section named [picon_url]
- comments are allowed with a "#" sign at the beginning of the line
- example file content:

# /etc/enigma2/chocholousekpicons.cfg

[picon_dir]
### picon directories - for PurE2 needs:
/media/ppmedia/picon
/media/ppmedia/picon_50x30
/data/picon_100x60
### picon directories - for Ellano.sk needs:
/usr/share/enigma2/hdg17_files/picon

#[picon_url]
#http://download.test.net/files/my_picons.7z
#http://example.com/files/iptv-special-picons.7z

5.0.210523
Minor fix when displaying information (MessageBox) after running plugin update

5.0.210602
When downloading 7z archives with picons via VPN, there is always an error. From now on, this will be reported as a specific error.

5.0.210701
Fixed minor BUG:
- after a 7zip archiver error occurred, the plugin algorithm continued to execute, despite the error

5.0.210717
Fixed minor BUGs:
- added shell console output to LOGs - only in case of errors extracting 7zip archives
- updated error code returned from the shell (divided by 256)
- adjusted position of the preview picon (to the center of the configuration window)
